Compass Warning
==========================

When you use Sass and Compass, you do no want developers to edit the CSS file. This extension will put a simple little warning into your CSS output to make sure nobody edits the CSS file. Win.

## To Use

`gem install compass-warning`

Add this to your config.rb
`require 'compass-warning'`

Add this to the top of your .sass or .scss file so that the warning gets added automatically.
`@import "compass-warning";`
